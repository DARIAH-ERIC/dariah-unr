## Number of Partner Institutions

Single number and a list of the Partner Institutions (including the National Coordinating Institution) composing the DARIAH National Consortium.

## Number of Contributors

Anyone who participates regularly in national DARIAH events, contributes to national initiatives or projects, acts as a contact point within an institution, receives national or institutional funding linked to DARIAH in your country is considered a DARIAH contributor. Categories that might be applicable in your country:

* At least one person per partner institution
* Anyone working in the national coordination office or secretariat, that is, in the daily organizing activities of the consortium
* Anyone directly paid or funded by the a national DARIAH (or CLARIAH) project
* People on "DARIAH-affiliated projects" (humanities infrastructure)
* People's whose work is submitted as DARIAH in kind contribution
* People making contribution but who are not paid (running DARIAH-relevant events)

## Number of Events

Any events held at the national level that contribute to DARIAH in your country should be counted. This includes presentations about DARIAH to raise awareness of it and its activities, or workshops and conferences dedicated to DARIAH. Please take into account both face-to-face and virtual meetings.

* large meetings (more than 50 people in attendance),
* medium sized meetings (20 to 50 people) and
* small meetings (less than 20 people).
* DARIAH Commissioned Event are big, international events that are commissioned by DARIAH and serve to fulfill a strategic interest. Examples include the Annual Event or the DARIAH Innovation Forum.

**Numbers of events provided will be used to help determine the national in-kind contributions as well.**

## Number of interactions via Outreach

It is important for DARIAH-EU to keep track of outreach statistics. Please give us the number of page impressions for any national DARIAH website that you may have, as well as the number of users and posts for your various social media accounts (Twitter, LinkedIn, Youtube, Facebook, etc.).

Several units can be used to capture these interactions:

* engagement
* followers
* impressions
* mention
* new\_content
* page\_views
* posts
* reach
* subscribers
* unique\_visitors
* views
* watch\_time

**Declaration of at least one national website and one social media channel will be used to help determine the national in-kind contributions as well.**

## Number of Interactions via Services

### Updating your national service list

Services in this list are the ones included in your national catalogue, as [maintained in the SSH Open Marketplace](https://marketplace.sshopencloud.eu/search?f.keyword=DARIAH+Resource), and displayed on the [DARIAH service catalogue](https://www.dariah.eu/tools-services/tools-and-services/). If you want to update the list, **please refer to** [**these guidelines**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l7sS4lAzbFgkY9etqwGxEBQP3C8jyn_I/view).

Please note that if you are adding resources to the Marketplace, they may not immediately appear in this tool. If this is the case, once you have made additions, or if you have any questions, please contact the UNR team.

### Adding number of interactions per service

This indicator attempts to capture the audience and usage of DARIAH's national services. Several units can be used to capture these interactions:

* downloads
* hits
* items
* jobs\_processed
* page\_views
* registered\_users
* searches
* sessions
* unique\_users
* visits
* websites\_hosted

## List of Software

Like services, software developed within the DARIAH national consortia should be added to the SSH Open Marketplace.

In distinction to services, which are available as web applications or APIs and can be used directly, software needs to be downloaded and installed or executed on the side of the user, to be used. The contribution should include the source code (and must be documented as well, not just orphan code). The code can be in any programming language, it can also be only a simple script dedicated to one specific task, as long as it is working and documented.

*No KPIs nor in-kind contributions calculations are attached to the software declarations. However your software list is compiled and included in your national tools and services catalogue.*

## Number of publications

The DARIAH definition of a publication is a significant and durable, accessible contribution to knowledge. A publication counts as DARIAH-affiliated when

* it resulted from work in the national consortium; funded by either DARIAH-EU or your national funding for DARIAHs/CLARIAH
* a DARIAH-affiliated tool or resource is cited in them;
* it is about DARIAH/CLARIAH or
* it is written by authors affiliated to DARIAH bodies or national DARIAHs.

They may be peer reviewed publications, or they may be reports,working papers, pre-prints, major releases of training material or even substantive blog posts. Importantly, please also include DOIs or [other Persistent Identifiers (handles, HAL IDs etc.](https://project-thor.readme.io/docs/project-glossary)) when reporting the bibliographical entries. You also do not need to report items deposited into DARIAH-EU HAL or Zenodo collections, as these are already automatically gathered.

**To add your publications to the [DARIAH Zotero library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/744474/dariah/library), please consult the [Guidelines "How to declare your DARIAH publications in Zotero?"](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ghBEwE6d3xJU8urxO1djhhdieiM9qOY2/view?usp=sharing).**

*The total number of publications you report each year is used as a KPI but not included in the in-kind contribution calculation.*

## Amount of funding leverage

This KPI covers the overall amount in Euros of any grant funding awarded to or within the DARIAH national consortium that is directly or indirectly related to DARIAH activities. Our goal here is to represent the amount of funding that DARIAH partner institutions or national consortia were able to raise due to their being part of an ESFRI-aligned infrastructure like DARIAH. Thus, national funding programs for your consortia count, as would any European, regional, or national funding in which being a member of DARIAH (or DARIAH-aligned national infra) was used as a compelling argument for funding. \
\
Funding from DARIAH itself (such as DARIAH Theme or Working Group funding) should not be included.

*This amount is not included in the in-kind contribution calculation.*

## Financial value of the national in-kind contribution

**How is a DARIAH national in-kind contribution calculated?**

Every DARIAH Member country must reach a certain threshold of contributions, set by the DARIAH General Assembly. In the past, National Coordinators were asked to calculate these sums by themselves. However, in line with the requests from National Coordinators and the ongoing reforms to contributions, we have decided to offer guidelines that allow In-Kind Contributions to be automatically calculated, following input to the Unified National Report. **For further information, please read the [Policy on the financial value of DARIAH services and other IKCs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A482x5XHwOsEZlmOcn5hw7lHy9muKMfeNs_T5BzQ4II/edit).**

In case of questions, please [contact the DARIAH DCO team](/contact).

## Data model and code repository of the DARIAH UNRs App

The DARIAH UNRs App has been developed and is maintained by Stefan Probst and Matej Durco from ACDH-CH. DARIAH-EU team following the development and liaising with National Coordinators: Edward Gray, Arnaud Roi, Simon Saldner, Laure Barbot.

The code repository is accessible via the [DARIAH GitHub](https://github.com/DARIAH-ERIC/dariah-unr), and the data model is available [here](/documentation/data-model).
